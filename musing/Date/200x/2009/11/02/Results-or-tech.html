True or false: &apos;&apos;Non-publication of negative results is extraordinarily common in science....'' ?
</p><p>
This comes from biomed world, specifically protein design, where some awesome claims&mdash;design of protein receptors to detect TNT (the explosive) among other things&mdash;have <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091012/full/news.2009.998.html">come under scrutiny<a/>.  The lab involved <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080509/full/453275a.html">recently retracted some other work</a>.
</p><p>
The quotation above is from Loren Looger, who was a PhD student on the project. He's referrring to unreported instances where a designed protein didn't bind the target and concludes that the omission &apos;&apos;did not seem inappropriate.'' This brings up an important distinction, I think, between negative results and experimental or procedural problems.
</p><p>
I'm not an experimentalist, but I'll draw an analogy with <code>coding</code>. Let's say you're coding up a simulation for a random walk on a one-dimensional lattice with the goal of estimating the waiting time to reach a certain node, <code>N</code>. Let's say you don't realize there's an exact calculation for this, but you do have some idea about the distribution that the simulation should produce. You use that expected distribution in debugging and error checking. Your first version produces answers that don't fit your distributional expectations, you find some errors and you fix them . The next version seems right. Then you do 10,000 simulations of 2000 steps each to find the waiting time to reach <code>N</code> (let's say N << 2000). You report the waiting time as the average of the 10,000 runs, discarding the results of the first version.
</p><p>
In this case it seems perfectly reasonable to not discuss the errors in getting the code right in reporting the results. The erroneous code and the results it produced represent technical issues encountered on the way to real, reportable results.
</p><p>
Let's say however, you were interested in the probability that of ever reaching <code>N</code>. You should similarly report that probability as the proportion of the 10,000 runs that <em>ever</em> reached <code>N</code>. If you discarded the results that never reached <code>N</code> you would say the probability is 1. In this case you would be omitting <em>real</em> (but negative) <em>results</em> and mis-reporting your findings.
</p><p>
I wonder, to which type of "negative results" is Looger referring?
