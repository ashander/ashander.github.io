high due to their vulnerability to demographic and environmental
stochasticity and negative impacts of human activity. We argue that
conservation actions that could aid ESPs are sometimes delayed because
of a fear of failure. In human psychology, the fear of failure is
composed of several distinct cognitive elements, including
"uncertainty about the future" and "upsetting important others."
Uncertainty about the future is often driven by infor- mation
obstacles in conservation: information is either not easily shared
among practitioners or informa- tion is lacking. Whereas, fear of
upsetting important others can be due to apprehension about angering
constituents, peers, funders, and other stakeholders. We present
several ways to address these fears in hopes of improving the
conservation process. We describe methods for increased information
sharing and improved decision-making in the face of uncertainty, and
recommend a shift in focus to cooperative actions and improving
methods for evaluating success. Our hope is that by tackling stumbling
blocks due to the apprehension of failure, conservation and management
organizations can take steps to move from fear to action.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="peer reviewed"></category><category term="Ph.D."></category><category term="conservation"></category><category term="small populations"></category><category term="extinction"></category><category term="stochastic"></category></entry><entry><title>Understanding the joint effects of plastic and evolutionary change on demography from time series</title><link href="http://www.ashander.info/posts/2014/01/understanding-joint-effects-plastic-evolutionary-poster/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-01-03T21:19:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Jaime Ashander</name></author><id>tag:www.ashander.info,2014-01-03:posts/2014/01/understanding-joint-effects-plastic-evolutionary-poster/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Background/Question/Methods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In nature, selection often fluctuates, but observed changes in traits may owe not only to selection but plasticity. Further, changes in traits due to selection and to plasticity do not have equal demographic effects: the cost of selection is paid through declines in population number or growth rate. Thus, observed trajectories of trait value and population number can depend on interactions between plasticity, evolution and environment. The extent to which these interactions affect observed trajectories depends on the demographic context. For example, it has long been known that natural selection interacts with density-dependence, which can dilute the effect of selection on population dynamics. Although recent methods decompose observed trait change into contributions due to evolution and plasticity, these methods have not yet fully accounted for the effect of selection on demography. In particular, including information about demographic change may sharpen inference of selection versus plasticity from time series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results/Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I develop a framework to account for the joint effects of plastic and evolutionary change on population and trait dynamics. This framework focuses on the influence of selection by a seasonal environment on timing of life history events, accommodating mechanistic hypotheses concerning the form of selection. I demonstrate how the framework can be used to infer the action of plasticity and genetic evolution from time series in a case study of changes in migration timing of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="phenotypic plasticity"></category><category term="ESA2013"></category><category term="time series"></category><category term="Bayesian methods"></category><category term="phenology"></category></entry><entry><title>Allee effect from parasite spill-back</title><link href="http://www.ashander.info/posts/2013/09/allee-effect-spillback/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-09-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Martin Krkosek</name></author><id>tag:www.ashander.info,2013-09-05:posts/2013/09/allee-effect-spillback/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The exchange of native pathogens between wild and domesticated animals
can lead to novel disease threats to wildlife. However, the dynamics
of wild host-parasite systems exposed to a reservoir of domesticated
hosts are not well understood. A simple mathematical model reveals
that the spill-back of native parasites from domestic to wild hosts
may cause a demographic Allee effect in the wild host population. A
second model is tailored to the particulars of pink salmon
(Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis),
for which parasite spill-back is a conservation and fishery
concern. In both models, parasite spill-back weakens the coupling of
parasite and wild host abundance-particularly at low host
abundance-causing parasites per host to increase as a wild host
population declines. These findings show that parasites shared across
host populations have effects analogous to those of generalist
predators and can similarly cause an unstable equilibrium in a focal
host population that separates persistence and extirpation. Allee
effects in wildlife arising from parasite spill-back are likely to be
most pronounced in systems where the magnitude of transmission from
domestic to wild host populations is high because of high parasite
abundance in domestic hosts, prolonged sympatry of domestic and wild
hosts, a high transmission coefficient for parasites, long-lived
parasite larvae, and proximity of domesticated populations to wildlife
migration corridors.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="peer reviewed"></category><category term="M.Sc."></category><category term="Allee effect"></category><category term="spillback"></category><category term="spillover"></category><category term="salmon"></category><category term="aquaculture"></category></entry><entry><title>Modifying River-Floodplain Systems: A Historical and Ecological Perspective</title><link href="http://www.ashander.info/posts/2012/10/igert-workshop-pres/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ross, Noam</name></author><id>tag:www.ashander.info,2012-10-01:posts/2012/10/igert-workshop-pres/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This presentation made 9/14 at the UC Davis REACH IGERT Floodplains workshop, by Jaime Ashander, Kelly Gravuer, Megan Kelso, Mary E.

&lt;p&gt;Floodplains have long been favored sites for agriculture and settlement due to their fertility, flat topography, and proximity to rivers for easy transport of goods. To reduce flood risk attendant with flood plain settlement, extensive flood protection structures have been built, including elaborate networks of levees. These modifications have greatly reduced the ecological benefits that intact river-flood plain systems provide. There is increasing recognition that flood plain reconnection can restore some ecological benefits while further reducing flood risk. However, few of these promising multi-purpose projects have been implemented because we lack both practical methodologies for estimating benefits and an understanding of historical conditions likely to facilitate project success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we use both historical and biophysical approaches to examine the trade-offs and synergies among the benefits of a proposed flood plain reconnection project in California. We examine the social evolution of attitudes and views that shaped floodplain management decisions, and that led to moments of conflict and cooperation among actors with varied interests. We also use hydraulic and population modeling to predict the effect of flood plain reconnection on key ecological benefits, flood risk, and availability of land for agriculture. In combination, these approaches provide a novel view on how social and biological forces constrain and provide opportunities in floodplain management. This understanding could support effective implementation of multi-purpose projects.&lt;/p&gt;

concern for conservation. In the ocean, many species display life
histories that separate juveniles from adults. For pink salmon
(Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus
salmonis), infection of juvenile salmon in early marine life occurs
near salmon sea-cage aquaculture sites and is associated with
declining abundance of wild salmon. Here, we develop a theoretical
model for the pink salmon/sea lice host–parasite system and use it to
explore the effects of aquaculture hosts, acting as reservoirs, on
dynamics. Because pink salmon have a 2-year lifespan, even- and
odd-year lineages breed in alternate years in a given river. These
lineages can have consistently different relative abundances, a
phenomenon termed “line dominance”. These dominance relationships
between host lineages serve as a useful probe for the dynamical
effects of introducing aquaculture hosts into this host–parasite
system. We demonstrate how parasite spillover (farm-to-wild transfer)
and spillback (wild-to-farm transfer) with aquaculture hosts can
either increase or decrease the line dominance in an affected wild
population. The direction of the effect depends on the response of
farms to wild-origin infection. If aquaculture parasites are managed
to a constant abundance, independent of the intensity of infections
from wild to farm, then line dominance increases. On the other hand,
if wild-origin parasites on aquaculture hosts are proportionally
controlled to their abundance then line dominance decreases.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="peer reviewed"></category><category term="M.Sc."></category><category term="line dominance"></category><category term="pink salmon"></category><category term="spillback"></category><category term="spillover"></category><category term="aquaculture"></category></entry></feed>
