      <description>Combining dynamical population ecology models with policy scenarios is an
important approach in both population biology and bioeconomics.
At its best, this approach may provide predictive understanding of future behavior.
But in complex socio-environmental systems (SES),
applying such theory requires large amounts of data and system understanding.
Reduced-complexity representations, like networks, provide promise but are not
yet linked to dynamic theory.
I am Co-leading a SESYNC working group focused on addressing this gap.</description>

      <description>The biologists have done their jobs. We know the life cycles and habitat requirements of endangered western fishes&amp;hellip; [A] successful management program could be devised and implemented for the Grand Canyon region. Current politics stand in the way, just as surely as politics of the 1960s aided and abetted our efforts to learn enough to save this fauna. &amp;ndash; W. L. Minckley (1991)
Over the past century, development of the Colorado River Basin for water resources changed a dynamic river into a managed system.</description>
