      <description>Human livelihoods and ecosystem fates are often linked by water.
I have a longstanding interest in the population biology of rivers,
and in using theory and methods from computational ecology to understand
and manage rivers to sustain aquatic life and nature&amp;rsquo;s benefits to people.
I am co-leading a SESYNC working group focused on
systems where shallow aquifers link groundwater use to instream flows,
leading to tradeoffs between users and potential tipping points.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my Ph.D., I sought to understand the consequences of trait change due to
evolutionary and plastic responses in changing environments, developing
theory on population dynamics resulting from these processes in stochastic environments. Using this theory
I showed how environmental autocorrelation controls the benefits to plasticity in new environments.
Further, these theories provide predictions about the entire distribution of population sizes and fitness
levels within a population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My M.Sc. research focused on the evolutionary ecology of sea lice, farmed and
wild salmon. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve become particularly interested in the ways in
which the combination of wild salmon migrations and salmon farm management
can influence chemical resistance evolution on farms, potentially providing a
benefits to people (which some have called &amp;ldquo;EVOsystem services&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
