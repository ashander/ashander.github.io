      <description>Combining dynamical population ecology models with policy scenarios is an
important approach in both population biology and bioeconomics.
At its best, this approach may provide predictive understanding of future behavior.
But in complex socio-environmental systems (SES),
applying such theory requires large amounts of data and system understanding.
Reduced-complexity representations, like networks, provide promise but are not
yet linked to dynamic theory.
I am Co-leading a SESYNC working group focused on addressing this gap.</description>

      <description>Human livelihoods and ecosystem fates are often linked by water.
I have a longstanding interest in the population biology of rivers,
and in using theory and methods from computational ecology to understand
and manage rivers to sustain aquatic life and nature&amp;rsquo;s benefits to people.
I am co-leading a SESYNC working group focused on
systems where shallow aquifers link groundwater use to instream flows,
leading to tradeoffs between users and potential tipping points.</description>

      <title>Inference in complex systems</title>

      <description>Inference of process from pattern is a major methodological challenge,
yet increasingly available &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; phenotypic and genomic data promises to shed light on
otherwise-difficult-to-collect vital rates in natural populations.
I develop and apply methods to use this data to
understand and conserve natural populations in human-dominated systems.</description>
