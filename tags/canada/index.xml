      <description>Today I mailed my absentee ballot for the S.F. municipal election. The Good People footed the bill to send it up here to me in Edmonton, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether they intended to spring for the return journey.
The only clue was the cryptic (to me) &amp;ldquo;U.S. Postage Paid. 39 USC 3406. PAR AVION&amp;rdquo; printed in the upper right hand corner of the return envelope. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why it would say &amp;lsquo;par avion&amp;rsquo; if they weren&amp;rsquo;t intending to pay, but if they were why would it say &amp;lsquo;U.</description>

      <description>The Coastal Voices blog at Living Oceans had an intersting post up remarking on the disparity between Canadian&amp;rsquo;s self-image as environmental progressives and reality&amp;mdash;that they appeaer to lag the U.S. in marine protection and other conservation issues. The author wondered why this might be. I left a comment, which I&amp;rsquo;ll expand on here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had similar thoughts and my guess is this blind spot for domestic environmental issues owes to Canada&amp;rsquo;s: (i) vast wild-lands (natural resources), (ii) very low population and (iii) long-standing economic dependence on extraction of those resources.</description>
