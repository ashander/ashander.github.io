      <title>So, you did some GLMs &amp; compared with AIC. Congrats!</title>

      <description>Here’s what you need to report in a paper about the model comparison:
residual devianceresidual dfdelta AICAIC weightYou should also report the null deviance and degrees of freedom,maybe in a table caption.
Thanks to Emilio Bruna for prompting this post andsuggesting its title. (Update 2015-12-14: thanks also to Ben Bolker for pointing out some issues in the first version of this post.</description>

      <description>It’s a long tradition in statistical graphics going from Tufte back toTukey andClevelandto advise against using bar charts. Many folks, includingme, have pejorativelycalled the common (in ecology, at least) bar chart + SE a “dynamite plot”.Although Ben Bolker has questionedthe wisdom of this sentiment, I think in most cases they’re worth avoiding. (I discuss this morein “When and here are dynamite plots appropriate” below.</description>

      <description>In a live walk-through on April 10 at the Davis R-Users Group, I gave a brief presentationmotivating this topic.This post expands and cleans up the code from that talk. If you justwant the code: download the .R file.

The point of this post isn’t the statistics of mixed models. For that, learningthe experimental design and statistics behind modern mixed models, I recommendsome relatively recent papers below.</description>
