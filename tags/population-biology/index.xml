      <description>Human livelihoods and ecosystem fates are often linked by water.
I have a longstanding interest in the population biology of rivers,
and in using theory and methods from computational ecology to understand
and manage rivers to sustain aquatic life and nature&amp;rsquo;s benefits to people.
I am co-leading a SESYNC working group focused on
systems where shallow aquifers link groundwater use to instream flows,
leading to tradeoffs between users and potential tipping points.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics in human-dominated systems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my Ph.D., I sought to understand the consequences of trait change due to
evolutionary and plastic responses in changing environments, developing
theory on population dynamics resulting from these processes in stochastic environments. Using this theory
I showed how environmental autocorrelation controls the benefits to plasticity in new environments.
Further, these theories provide predictions about the entire distribution of population sizes and fitness
levels within a population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My M.Sc. research focused on the evolutionary ecology of sea lice, farmed and
wild salmon. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve become particularly interested in the ways in
which the combination of wild salmon migrations and salmon farm management
can influence chemical resistance evolution on farms, potentially providing a
benefits to people (which some have called &amp;ldquo;EVOsystem services&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The biologists have done their jobs. We know the life cycles and habitat requirements of endangered western fishes&amp;hellip; [A] successful management program could be devised and implemented for the Grand Canyon region. Current politics stand in the way, just as surely as politics of the 1960s aided and abetted our efforts to learn enough to save this fauna. &amp;ndash; W. L. Minckley (1991)
Over the past century, development of the Colorado River Basin for water resources changed a dynamic river into a managed system.</description>
