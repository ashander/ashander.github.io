      <description>Human livelihoods and ecosystem fates are often linked by water.
I have a longstanding interest in the population biology of rivers,
and in using theory and methods from computational ecology to understand
and manage rivers to sustain aquatic life and nature&amp;rsquo;s benefits to people.
I am co-leading a SESYNC working group focused on
systems where shallow aquifers link groundwater use to instream flows,
leading to tradeoffs between users and potential tipping points.</description>
