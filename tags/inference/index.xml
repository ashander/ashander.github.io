      <description>We describe a way to record all of the gene-trees along a segment of genome, as well as how genetic material is passed down through the pedigree, during a forwards-time population genetic simulation. To make effective use of this information, we describe both efficient storage methods for this embellished pedigree as well as a way to remove all information that is irrelevant to the genetic history of a given set of individuals, which dramatically reduces the required amount of storage space.</description>

      <title>Inference in complex systems</title>

      <description>Inference of process from pattern is a major methodological challenge,
yet increasingly available &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; phenotypic and genomic data promises to shed light on
otherwise-difficult-to-collect vital rates in natural populations.
I develop and apply methods to use this data to
understand and conserve natural populations in human-dominated systems.</description>

      <title>Negative results or technical problems?</title>
      <link>https://www.ashander.info/posts/2009/11/omitting-negative-results/</link>

      <description>True or false: &amp;ldquo;Non-publication of negative results is extraordinarily common in science&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; ?
This comes from biomed world, specifically protein design, where some awesome claims&amp;mdash;design of protein receptors to detect TNT (the explosive) among other things&amp;mdash;have come under scrutiny. The lab involved recently retracted some other work.
The quotation above is from Loren Looger, who was a PhD student on the project. He&amp;rsquo;s referrring to unreported instances where a designed protein didn&amp;rsquo;t bind the target and concludes that the omission &amp;ldquo;did not seem inappropriate.</description>

      <title>Market substitution in aquaculture</title>

      <description>A recent article in BioScience [1] focused on the relationship between aquaculture and conservation. This topic is quite interesting to me, but it&amp;rsquo;s obviously subtle. I don&amp;rsquo;t have well-defined thoughts except that (i) aquaculture could theoretically relieve pressure on some wild fisheries and (ii) certain aquaculture operations have proven negative impacts on some ecosystems.
This paper aims to highlight broad trends in capture and culture fisheries and quantify effects on biodiversity.</description>
