The
 [Coastal Voices](http://coastalvoices.blogspot.com/2009/08/last-few-days-have-seen-flurry-of.html#comment)
 blog at Living Oceans had an intersting post up remarking on the
 disparity between Canadian's self-image as environmental progressives
 and reality---that they appeaer to lag the U.S. in marine protection
 and other conservation issues. The author wondered _why_ this might
 be. I left a comment, which I'll expand on here.

I've had similar thoughts and my guess is this blind spot for domestic
environmental issues owes to Canada's: (i) vast wild-lands (natural
resources), (ii) very low population and (iii) long-standing economic
dependence on extraction of those resources. Canada is simply less far
along in 'using up' its domestic natural resources, and thus less
steeped in the urgency of purpose that comes with realizing human uses
can exhuast nature's bounty.

From my vague understanding of history, nature's inexhaustability was
unquestioned during early European settlement and the bounty of the
Territories consistently awed settlers during westward expansion. The
gradual 'filling up' of the U.S. and concomitant loss of wilderness
and formerly abundant species eventually fostered a movement to
conserve wild lands for their own sake (or at least for the sake of
hunting).

I don't think the U.S. 'lead' on these issues owes to anything other
than our other lead---on using up our finite resources. Of course,
despite that other lead, U.S. laws aren't as strong as they might
be---in particular environmental-protection measures typically defer
to entrenched local users---so I guess both U.S. and Canadian
attitudes about conservation could use a bost.
