![Salish Sea from WWU]({filename}/images/Freelan_SalishSea_small.jpg)

``Salish Sea'' is on its way to being an official name in the U.S. and
Canada. Can <a

Cascadia</a> be far behind?


Stefan Freelan at WWU made the beautiful map of the region here. [His
page](http://myweb.facstaff.wwu.edu/%7Estefan/SalishSea.htm) has lots
of details about the region and the history of the term.
