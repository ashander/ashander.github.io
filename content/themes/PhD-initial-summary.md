My Ph.D. is focused on modelling populations that exhibit rapid responses to environmental change.
    <p>I focus on understanding the consequences of trait change due
      to evolutionary and plastic responses in changing enviornments.
     For some years, I have been developing theory on population dynamics resulting from these processes.
	    Most of this theoretical work is in collaboration with <a href="http://lmchevin.weebly.com/">Luis-Miguel Chevin</a> and
	    my PhD supervisor <a href="http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/">Marissa Baskett</a>
      during my PhD at UC Davis in <a href="http://www.eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/">Population Biology</a>.
      These interests also extend back to my my Master's research, which focused on the
      ecological and
      evolutionary dynamics of sea lice and salmonids
