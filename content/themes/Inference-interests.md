My current focus is inference of population processes from phenotypic and genomic data.

During my postdoc with Brad Shaffer at UCLA, I am working in collaboration with <a href="http://ralphlab.usc.edu/">Peter Ralph</a>
at University of Oregon, to developi methods that use genomic data to inform
demographic models of the desert tortoise (<em>Gopherus agassizii</em>).
These models will enable us to analyze effects of scenarios for development in
the Mojave desert on the tortoise's population viability.

Another project concerns directly inferring the relative strengths of plasticity and
genetic evolution (heritability) from a time series of trait and abundance data.
This problem is particularly challenging if selection might vary across time.
During graduate school, I began work on using a Bayesian state-space model to
address this problem by quantifying how prior information influences
estimates from numerical simulations.
I presented this method (at ESA in 2013, and the International Statistical
Ecology Conference in 2014, winning awards at both conferences) and I am
applying it to data in case studies, including Sockeye salmon (_Oncorhynchus nerka_
using public data from Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, WA).
