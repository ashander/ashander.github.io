Several projects apply concepts and methods from population biology to applied issues in river management and conservation:

* IGERT collaborative project on [Floodplain management: opportunities, challenges, and successes](http://reach.ucdavis.edu/programs/floodplains.html) with collaborators Kelly Graveur, Megan Kelso, Mary Mendoza, and [Noam Ross](http://www.noamross.net/).

* Colorado River Class and Grand Canyon trip: "The Changing Colorado River".
