In 2010 I started a PhD at <a href="http://www.ucdavis.edu">UC
Davis</a> in the Population Biology Graduate Group. I'm working with
<a
href="http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/research.html">Marissa
Baskett</a> and partially funded by the NSF REACH IGERT and Population
Biology Graduate Group.

Prior to arriving at UC Davis I was a <a
 href="http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/graduate-training-igtc/mathematical-biology">PIMS
 IGTC fellow in mathematical biology</a> with <a
 href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mlewis/">Prof.  Mark Lewis</a> at
 the <a href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mathbio">Centre for
 Mathematical Biology</a>/<a
 href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/">Department of Mathematical and
 Statistical Sciences</a> at the <a
 href="http://www.ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a>.


After earning a B.Sc. in physics from Stanford University <a
 href="http://www.stanford.edu"> Stanford University</a> in 2004, I
 spent time as a consultant dealing with intellectual property in the
 SF Bay area.
