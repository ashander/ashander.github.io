I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in <a href="https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/Shaffer/">the Shaffer lab</a>
at UCLA.
Working in collaboration with <a href="http://ralphlab.usc.edu/">Peter Ralph</a> (now at U of Oregon), we are developing methods that use genomic data to inform demographic models of the desert tortoise (<em>Gopherus agassizii</em>).
These models will enable us to analyze effects of scenarios for development in
the Mojave desert on the population viability of the tortoise.


In September 2016, I received my Ph.D. at <a href="http://www.ucdavis.edu">UC
Davis</a> in Population Biology Graduate Group. I worked with <a
href="http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/research.html">Marissa
Baskett</a> and partially funded by the NSF REACH IGERT and Population Biology
Graduate Group.

Prior to arriving at UC Davis, I completed a M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics. I was a <a
 href="http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/graduate-training-igtc/mathematical-biology">PIMS
 IGTC fellow in mathematical biology</a> with <a
 href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mlewis/">Prof.  Mark Lewis</a> at
 the <a href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mathbio">Centre for
 Mathematical Biology</a>/<a
 href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/">Department of Mathematical and
 Statistical Sciences</a> at the <a
 href="http://www.ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a>.


Previously, after earning a B.Sc. in physics from <a
href="http://www.stanford.edu"> Stanford University</a>, I worked as
a consultant dealing with intellectual property in the SF Bay area.
