My Ph.D. support has included a two-year traineeship with the <a
href="http://reach.ucdavis.edu/" >REACH IGERT</a>, as well as a
one-year Bridge RA-ship funded through the same program.

My M.Sc. was supported largely by the <a
 href="http://www.pims.math.ca/"> Pacific Institute of Mathematical
 Sciences<a> <a
 href="http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/igtc">International Graduate
 Training Centre</a> in <a
 href="http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/graduate-training-igtc/mathematical-biology">mathematical
 biology</a>. I also received a (1 year) University of Alberta
 Master's Scholarship, which paid for tuition during my first term.
 My research project was also part of an <a
 href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mlewis/research1/index.htm#sls">ongoing
 project on sea lice</a> funded in part by <a
 href="http://www.mitacs.math.ca/main.php">MITACS</a>.
