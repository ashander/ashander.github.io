Human food production activities can dominate natural systems, altering
ecological and evolutionary aspects of the environment. Disease-mediated
interactions are of particular concern. For example, parasites may "spill-over"
from farms to wildlife. Parasites isolated on farms can evolve resistance to
treatment chemicals , but "spill-back" from wildlife to farms may alter
evolutionary dynamics. Here, we consider exchange of parasites (_Lepeophtheirus
salmonis_) between wild (_Oncorhynchus gorbuscha_) and farmed salmon. We derive
and analyze discrete-time models that implicitly include wild salmon
migrations. First, we extend a standard fisheries model to show parasite
exchange affects "line-dominance" in the population ecology of salmon. Second,
we extend a classic population genetics model to show that wild salmon can
theoretically provide an "ecosystem service" by delaying the onset of chemical
resistance in parasites on farms. This service, however is affected by
a nonlinear feedback if farm parasites spill-back to affect wild salmon.
