The potential for extirpation of extremely small populations (ESPs) is
high due to their vulnerability to demographic and environmental
stochasticity and negative impacts of human activity. We argue that
conservation actions that could aid ESPs are sometimes delayed because
of a fear of failure. In human psychology, the fear of failure is
composed of several distinct cognitive elements, including
"uncertainty about the future" and "upsetting important others."
Uncertainty about the future is often driven by infor- mation
obstacles in conservation: information is either not easily shared
among practitioners or informa- tion is lacking. Whereas, fear of
upsetting important others can be due to apprehension about angering
constituents, peers, funders, and other stakeholders. We present
several ways to address these fears in hopes of improving the
conservation process. We describe methods for increased information
sharing and improved decision-making in the face of uncertainty, and
recommend a shift in focus to cooperative actions and improving
methods for evaluating success. Our hope is that by tackling stumbling
blocks due to the apprehension of failure, conservation and management
organizations can take steps to move from fear to action.
