Exchange of diseases between domesticated and wild animals is a rising
concern for conservation. In the ocean, many species display life
histories that separate juveniles from adults. For pink salmon
(Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus
salmonis), infection of juvenile salmon in early marine life occurs
near salmon sea-cage aquaculture sites and is associated with
declining abundance of wild salmon. Here, we develop a theoretical
model for the pink salmon/sea lice host–parasite system and use it to
explore the effects of aquaculture hosts, acting as reservoirs, on
dynamics. Because pink salmon have a 2-year lifespan, even- and
odd-year lineages breed in alternate years in a given river. These
lineages can have consistently different relative abundances, a
phenomenon termed “line dominance”. These dominance relationships
between host lineages serve as a useful probe for the dynamical
effects of introducing aquaculture hosts into this host–parasite
system. We demonstrate how parasite spillover (farm-to-wild transfer)
and spillback (wild-to-farm transfer) with aquaculture hosts can
either increase or decrease the line dominance in an affected wild
population. The direction of the effect depends on the response of
farms to wild-origin infection. If aquaculture parasites are managed
to a constant abundance, independent of the intensity of infections
from wild to farm, then line dominance increases. On the other hand,
if wild-origin parasites on aquaculture hosts are proportionally
controlled to their abundance then line dominance decreases.
