Phenotypic plasticity and its evolution may help evolutionary rescue in a novel
and stressful environment, especially if environmental novelty reveals cryptic
genetic variation that enables the evolution of increased plasticity (panels
a and b in the figure below).
But the environmental stochasticity ubiquitous in natural systems may alter
these predictions (panel c).
This might occur, for example if high plasticity amplifies
phenotype-environment mismatches.
Although previous studies have highlighted
this potential detrimental effect of plasticity in stochastic environments,
they have not investigated how it affects extinction risk in the context of
evolutionary rescue and with evolving plasticity.

My co-authors and I investigated this question by integrating stochastic
demography with quantitative genetic theory in a model with simultaneous change
in the mean and predictability (temporal autocorrelation) of the environment.
We developed an approximate prediction of long-term persistence under the new
pattern of environmental fluctuations with heightened plasticity (horizontal
black line in panel d, above).
While plasticity _eventually_ decreases, and the growth rate increases,
plasticity remains high---and the growth rate at the approximate value---for hundreds of generations (note the log scale in panels b and c, above).

We then compared predictions with numerical simulations of growth rate (top
row, figure below), short-term (middle row) and long-term (bottom row)
extinction risk for a range of values for predictability, additive variance in plasticity, and size of the shift in the mean optimum from the old to the novel environment.

Overall, our results show that reduced predictability increases extinction risk
and reduces persistence.
The reason this occurs is that in low predictability environments, mismatches
increases stochastic load during rescue and prevent persistence.
This understanding of how stochastic demography, phenotypic plasticity, and
evolution interact when evolution acts on cryptic genetic variation revealed in
a novel environment can inform expectations for invasions, extinctions, or the
emergence of chemical resistance in pests.
