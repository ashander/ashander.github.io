The exchange of native pathogens between wild and domesticated animals
can lead to novel disease threats to wildlife. However, the dynamics
of wild host-parasite systems exposed to a reservoir of domesticated
hosts are not well understood. A simple mathematical model reveals
that the spill-back of native parasites from domestic to wild hosts
may cause a demographic Allee effect in the wild host population. A
second model is tailored to the particulars of pink salmon
(Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis),
for which parasite spill-back is a conservation and fishery
concern. In both models, parasite spill-back weakens the coupling of
parasite and wild host abundance-particularly at low host
abundance-causing parasites per host to increase as a wild host
population declines. These findings show that parasites shared across
host populations have effects analogous to those of generalist
predators and can similarly cause an unstable equilibrium in a focal
host population that separates persistence and extirpation. Allee
effects in wildlife arising from parasite spill-back are likely to be
most pronounced in systems where the magnitude of transmission from
domestic to wild host populations is high because of high parasite
abundance in domestic hosts, prolonged sympatry of domestic and wild
hosts, a high transmission coefficient for parasites, long-lived
parasite larvae, and proximity of domesticated populations to wildlife
migration corridors.
