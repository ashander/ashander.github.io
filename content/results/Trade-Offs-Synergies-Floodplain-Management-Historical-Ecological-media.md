To reduce flood risk attendant with flood plain settlement, extensive flood protection structures have been built, including elaborate networks of levees. These modifications have greatly reduced the ecological benefits that intact river-flood plain systems provide.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">There is increasing recognition that</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;flood plain reconnection can restore some ecological benefits while further reducing flood risk. However, few of these promising multi-purpose projects have been implemented because we lack both practical methodologies for estimating benefits and an understanding of historical conditions likely to facilitate project success.</span></p>
