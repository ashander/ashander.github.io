A brand new "-gate" on the climate science front has me thinking about
the relationship between science and the public. A big issue in
communicating science stems from the fundamental disconnect between
science as practiced and science as taught in introductory formats,
e.g. in high school.

Most people learn science as fact. The reality is emerging scientific
knowledge (in fact all scientific knowledge) is uncertain. Those who
disagree idealogically with the state of scientific knowlege highlight
this uncertainty. Because the public doesn't understand what science
_really_ is, the effect is to sew seeds of doubt.

A more productive focus would be to discuss quantitative measures of
uncertainty and degrees of risk tolerance. The notion that certainty
is possible, however, short circuits this discussion.
