This is a short rumination on authorship, credit, and academic contributions
that aren't papers. (I'm thinking in particualr of data sets and software code.)

When science involves lots of resources deployed to answer big questions, long
author lists 

a cost of doing business in our 
era of collaboration, large datasets, and powerful software?_ 


Two things draw me to  discuss this question:

* a recent paper with a lot of authors, all of whom seem to deserve authorship
  even under the relatively strict guidelines I strive to follow, raised some
  hackles and got coverage in Nature News
* the broader issue of standards for authorship and evaluation of non-paper
  scholarly output

The first thing, and ultimate reason for this post is [a recent paper on Muller F elements in _D.
melanogaster_](http://www.g3journal.org/content/early/2015/03/04/g3.114.015966.abstract)
that had 1014 authors. The publishing journal, G3, [explained the backstory on their
blog](http://genestogenomes.org/undergrads-power-genomics-research/). The paper
came out of a collaboration between undergraduate classes at some 63
institutions. Long author lists are pretty common in some fields, but less so
in biology and the paper [spawned some comments](http://www.nature.com/news/fruit-fly-paper-has-1-000-authors-1.17555).


As Gordon Watts mentions in this piece, in fields like particle physics, where
such lists are common, academics "know how to interpret" the lists. But, this
long list was on a biology paper. Large teams are very common in some areas of
biology, and becoming more so. This is especially true in areas like genomics.
But, in much of biology, authorship teams are still small.

And, in many universities, issues like this can arise when folks from one field apply their standards
to another.

I'm sympathetic. My major was physics, and in an early research experience
I was a cog in a particle-physics machine. Just a summer intern, I wasn't
a member of any authorship team, but my colleagues introduced me to the
authorship standards in place at large particle facilities. When I started more
seriously working in science, on a masters mathematical ecology, we used
stricter standards. The [authorship guidelines from my Master's
lab](http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mlewis/links/collab_author_guide.htm) follow
[Sahu and Abraham (2000)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11298473) in
recommending authors meet several criteria:

> (1) make a substantial contribution to (a) conception and design, and/or (b) acquisition of data, and/or (c)
analysis and/or (d) interpretation of data,

> (2) are involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and

> (3) approve the final version to be published.

The guidelines stress that "**all three of these conditions must be met** to
satisfy the authorship criteria" (emphasis mine) These strict standards are
driven in part by the belief that "all coauthors are accountable for the
published work" and must "be able to defend the work, the results, and
everything else" in the paper.
