An NYT column reports on <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/science/20obseal.html">fur
seal whiskers</a> serving as biogeochemical records. This kind of data
is more and more common, e.g. otoliths, feathers, shells. What can
scientists do with it?

I've mainly seen biogeochemical markers used to infer relatively
static traits of individual like origin and age or to make
coarse-scale statements about diet (trophic level). The fur seal study
got trophic information at a bit finer scale (within-year variation),
connecting that to yearly migrations. This is great, but I think
really exciting work lies a little further along this path.

Essentially these markers can integrate several years of life for an
individual---recording diet and sometimes other environmental
features---in some cases they record the entire lifespan. The
combination of these integrating markers with tagging data
(effectively 'differential' markers) is especially exciting. It would
be cool to see cases where hypotheses (models) developed using one
type of data were selected using the other type.
