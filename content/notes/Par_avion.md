Today I mailed my absentee ballot for the S.F. municipal election. The
Good People footed the bill to send it up here to me in Edmonton, I'm
not sure whether they intended to spring for the return journey.

The only clue was the cryptic (to me) "U.S. Postage Paid. 39 USC
3406. PAR AVION" printed in the upper right hand corner of the return
envelope.  I'm not sure why it would say 'par avion' if they weren't
intending to pay, but if they were why would it say 'U.S' postage?
Confusing.

In any case the Post Canada folks weren't confused and knew I had to
pay $2.
