>We help companies to grow by helping them to raise capital...
Companies that grow create wealth. This, in turn, allows
people to have jobs that create more growth and more wealth. It's a
virtuous cycle. We have a social purpose. --- Lloyd Blankfein

Ed Abbey wrote that Blankfein's virtuous cycle, growth for the sake of
growth, is "the logic of the cancer cell". Whether or not you buy this
anti-captialist mumbo jumbo, there _is_ something cancerous about a
jobless, finance-led recovery. One of the hallmarks of cancer is <a

seem that Blankfein's cycle requires jobs. Thus a jobless "recovery"
indicates that the finance sector has developed autonomy from the
signals of the labor market.
