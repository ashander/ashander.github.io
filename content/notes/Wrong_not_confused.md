Quoting Turchin (1998) quoting Hull (1988) quoting Bacon (?) : 

>In science it is better to be wrong than confused.

The point is, though a mathematical model that purports to repesent
reality will be wrong, one with clear definitions and assumptions can
be helpful. Mathematical modeling is a tool to move from confusion
about a process to making clear (if wrong) statements about that
process.
