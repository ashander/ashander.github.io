      <description>The biologists have done their jobs. We know the life cycles and habitat requirements of endangered western fishes&amp;hellip; [A] successful management program could be devised and implemented for the Grand Canyon region. Current politics stand in the way, just as surely as politics of the 1960s aided and abetted our efforts to learn enough to save this fauna. &amp;ndash; W. L. Minckley (1991)
Over the past century, development of the Colorado River Basin for water resources changed a dynamic river into a managed system.</description>

      <description>Human food production activities can dominate natural systems, altering ecological and evolutionary aspects of the environment. Disease-mediated interactions are of particular concern. For example, parasites may &amp;ldquo;spill-over&amp;rdquo; from farms to wildlife. Parasites isolated on farms can evolve resistance to treatment chemicals , but &amp;ldquo;spill-back&amp;rdquo; from wildlife to farms may alter evolutionary dynamics. Here, we consider exchange of parasites (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) between wild (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and farmed salmon. We derive and analyze discrete-time models that implicitly include wild salmon migrations.</description>
